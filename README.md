# Lovercraft-Austin-and-Docker
When a book has entered “the public domain,” its copyright has expired and the material now belongs to the general public. Not only does this mean that anybody can creatively reinvent that original work without paying a penny but also that this book is now free for anyone to read. Two of the books which entered the public domain are HP Lovecraft’s Beyond the Wall of Sleep, and Jane Austin’s Pride and Prejudice.
